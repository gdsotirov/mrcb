# Multi Router Configuration Backup TODO

This is summary of features that could be implemented in future after
the basic functionality of the utility is ready:

* mange exports with Git in a _private_ GitHub repository as an option
  to local directory;
* ~~configurable SSH authentication with key instead of password~~;
* compression of the exports in local directory;
* ~~make binary backups together with plain text export when difference is~~
  ~~detected (suggested by Boyan Sotirov)~~;
* check and remove sensitive data in exports (i.e. as complement to
  hide-sensitive option of /export command);
* e-mail notifications about successful/unsuccessful backups;
* ~~Python 3 support~~.
